language-practice
=================

A collection of algorithms implemented in different languages as a practice and learning method.

I was inspired by a number of people and books to start practicing coding in addition to an ever-increasing list of languages I want to try. This kind of repository seemed like a good way to get started.

Algorithms
==========
Primarily I'm looking at algorithms that are good fundamental algorithms as well as more challenging ones.


Languages
=========
None so far.

This is the list of languages I want to implement the algorithms in:
* Go
* Ruby
* Erlang
* Haskell
* Clojure
* Scala
* Rust
* Elixir
* Java
* Swift
* Objective-C
* Javascript
* Scala
* D
